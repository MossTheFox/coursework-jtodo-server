JToDo - A Java To-Do List (Backend)
------------------------------

### Overview

This is the backend of [JToDo](https://github.com/MossTheFox/coursework-jtodo) - a Java To-Do List App created for coursework only.

It is part of the coursework. The course is about Java, but I feel better to use Java to create the client-side of the app only.

This is the backend of the app, created with Node.js. Database using MongoDB.

Notice that all the database connection URLs in the ```.env``` file needs to be changed if you are going to host it on your own server.

It is recommended to use MongoDB Atlas for hosting the database for testing purposes.

Also, notice that the user authentication process shares some backend service with [app.mxowl.com](https://app.mxowl.com/) whose backend is not open source for security reasons. You may need to implement your own authentication process.
